# InteractiveProgramming
Emily Lepert and Vicky McDermott - Team McLepermott

What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?
The main idea of our project is to create an interactive map and age scale that highlights the most likely region the user if from and the likeliest age they have. We will do this by having them fill out a survey. This survey will update the map live (ie: fix the grammar of a sentence, and as you add commas, the map updates). We’ve found two datasets that have age and location as part of it leading us to believe that we can create a questionnaire that will then predict where someone is from and what their age is. Our MVP is a map and age scale with at least one question. A stretch goal is a well developed visual platform.
As questionnaire gets filled out, a crack appears along the screen to symbolize how far along you are in the questionnaire. When you fill out an earthquake answer, the screen shakes as it updates the colors and age scale.
What are your learning goals for this project (for each member)?
Vicky: Learning how to make something interactive in Python, getting better at documentation and unit testing
Emily: Creating something visual with Python, delving into manipulating datasets in Python, making something interactive, getting better at documentation
What libraries are you planning to use? (if you don’t know enough yet, please outline how you will decide this question during the beginning phase of the project).
We’ve identified the datasets that we are going to use (see bottom). Once we have created a first run of our project in only text-based form, we will probably need some graphing libraries (matplotlib, etc…)
What do you plan to accomplish by the mid-project check-in? (See below for some generic goals; edit to suit your particular project)
Text based final working product and map that we can control colors for. 
All libraries installed, diagram of classes and objects we plan to create, plan for who is going to write/finish each class
What do you view as the biggest risks to you being successful on this project?
Figuring out how to make the visualizations work, and figuring out how to come to conclusions based on survey information
